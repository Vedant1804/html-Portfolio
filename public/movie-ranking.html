3 Idiots is a thought-provoking, heartwarming, and hilariously entertaining film that challenges 
India’s rigid education system while celebrating friendship and the joy of learning. With memorable 
performances, witty dialogues, and emotional depth, it follows three engineering students navigating 
societal pressures, parental expectations, and their own dreams — all driven by the rebellious spirit of Rancho,

  breathtaking visuals, and unforgettable characters. Set in the mythical kingdom of Mahishmati, it masterfully weaves
   together themes of betrayal, love, valor, and destiny through the story of Amarendra Baahubali and his son Mahendra.
